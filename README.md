# GPA Calculator
This Python project is designed to calculate the Grade Point Average (GPA) of a student based on their input of grades for various components of their courses. It utilizes dictionaries to store and calculate the GPA, considering the weights assigned to each item, such as the **midterm**, **assignments**, **quizzes**, **projects**, **attendance**, and **final exam**. Additionally, the project allows the user to input the number of credits for each course, enabling them to determine if they can achieve a **specific GPA** in the upcoming semester, considering their current GPA, credit hours, and the number of credits for the next semester.

## Features
The GPA Calculator project provides the following features:

* Input and Storage of Grades: The project allows the user to input and store grades for different components of their courses, such as the midterm, assignments, quizzes, projects, attendance, and final exam. The grades are stored in a dictionary for each course.

* Weighted Calculation: The project calculates the weighted GPA by considering the assigned weights for each grade component. The user can assign a weight to each component, ensuring that the GPA calculation reflects the significance of each item.

* Credit Hours: The user can input the number of credits associated with each course. The project takes into account the credit hours to calculate the overall GPA accurately.

* GPA Calculation: Based on the stored grades and their weights, the project calculates the GPA for each course and the overall GPA for all courses combined. The GPA is calculated on a scale of 4.0, which is the standard GPA scale used in many educational institutions.

* Goal GPA Calculation: The project allows the user to specify a desired GPA for the upcoming semester. The project determines if the user can achieve the desired GPA using the current GPA, credit hours, and the number of credits for the next semester.

# Usage
To use the GPA Calculator project, follow these steps:

1. Run the Python script in a compatible environment.

2. Follow the prompts to input the required information, such as the grades for each course component, weights, credit hours, and desired GPA for the next semester.

3. The project will calculate the GPA based on the provided information and display the results.

4. then you can choose to know which gpa you should get the next semester to get a specific GPA
